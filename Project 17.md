__Project 17: Microcontroller based electronic lock__

__Description:__
This is a simple project where a door is opened based on an electronic lock. The door is attached to a motor which is relay driven. A keypad and an LCD is connected to a PIC microcontroller. The PIC controller is coded according the requirements of the user.  When the password is entered through the keypad, it is scanned and compared with the original password stored in the microcontroller. If both of them matches, the door is opened and the message "Access granted" is displayed on the LCD. If they doesn't match, then the message "Access denied" is displayed on the LCD. Also, a master key code can be stored which can be used as an access code to change the password.
