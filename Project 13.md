__Project 13: RFID based attendance system__

__Description:__
This is a simple project where RFID technology is used to take attendance automatically. An RFID reader is connected to a microcontroller which is connected to an LCD display and database. All the students are given uniqye RFID tags. When entering a class, they must place the RFID tag in front of the RFID reader. If the tag is present in the database, the concerned student is marked present. If a tag is placed whose number does not exist in the database, the LCD displays a message that the user is unauthorised.

The main unit in this project is the microcontroller. It acts as the data receiver, manipulator and executor of the tasks. Microcontrollers like AVR and 8051 can be used for this project. Also, they can be coded using a programming board.
