__Description:__
This is quite a simple project which uses the Raspberry Pi microcomputer to control the music player in a car using its touchscreen. The main components involved are :
Raspberry Pi Model B kit
Tontec 7-in touchscreen
This project has a lot of learning outcomes. It involves designing the circuit, programming the controllers, configuring them with the LAN and so on.

Raspberry Pi is basically a small, single-board microcomputer which can be used to model complex electronic circuits. It can be used to create a miniature desktop or a tablet,to control miniature robots, to create our own cloud storage or evn in home automation systems. The various programming interfaces it supports makes it a versatile electronic component available in the market.
