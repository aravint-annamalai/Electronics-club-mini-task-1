__Project 21: Automatic solar grass cutter__

__Description:__
This is a simple robot attached with a rotating blade and a solar cell. This robot is powered by a solar cell and controlled by an 8051 microcontroller. The robot is also attached with an ultrasonic sensor to detect any obstacle in front of it. If any obstacle is present, the microcontroller will turn the robot by sending appropriate signals to the motor drivers that control the locomotive motors. The blade is always rotated in order to cut the grass. Also, the battery is recharged using solar cell and hence, external charging is not needed.
