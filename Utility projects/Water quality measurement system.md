__Project 25: Water quality measurement system__

__Description:__
This project acts as a water quality tester and also sends the collected data via GSM module for monitoring. It is a simple project which comprises of sensors to measure the required values, a microcontroller to process those values, an LCD display and a GSM module for data monitoring. It has a lot of scope since the time taken to note the values using this device would be very much lesser than the time taken in conventional methods.

The important components are the 8051 microcontroller and GSM module. It is the microcontroller that processes the data and acts as the integrator between the testing (sensors) and the user interface (GSM and LCD display) components. The GSM module acts as a wireless transmittor that transmits the processed data to the monitoring centre via SMS. The microcontroller is coded using embedded C language.
