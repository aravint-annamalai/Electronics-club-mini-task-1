__Project 20: Railway crack detecting robot__

__Description:__
This is a simple robot which detects the cracks on railway lines using an LED-LDR detection mechanism. The robot has 4 dc motors which serves as the locomoters of the bot. Also, it has a GPS and a  GSM modules for wireless transmission of the location to the authorised people. All these modules are integrated using an AT89C51 microcontroller.

The principle of detecting crack is based on the working of LDR. LDR is a light-intensity-dependent resistor whose resistance decreases when the brightness of light falling on it increases. So, when an LED and an LDR are placed in parallel with an obstacle between them and when the obstacle is suddenly removed, there will be a change in the resistance of the LDR. In this way, a crack could be detected. Once, it is detected, the bot stops and sends the lcoation obtained from the GPS module via the GSM module. Instead of GSM, even Wi-Fi module like ESP8266 or Zigbee could be used which also enables data storage in the cloud.
