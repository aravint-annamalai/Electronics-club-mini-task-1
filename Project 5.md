__Project 5: Obstacle avoiding robot__

__Description:__
This is a simple mini-project where a small robot detects obstacles based on the data received by the IR sensors placed on its front. The design of the bot is it has two motor wheels at the back and a free wheel at the front. Also, two infrared sensors are mounted on either side at the front such that the sensors has maximum coverage. Based on the data received fro  the sensors, the bot decides whether to turn left or right or continue straight.

The components used mainly are IR generator and receiver(which together comprise the IR sensor),motor drive L293D and microcontroller AT89C2051. The data received by the sensors are processed by the microcontroller based on the code burnt in it. After the processing is done, the motor drives are activated according to the processed output.
