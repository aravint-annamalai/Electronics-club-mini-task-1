__Project 14: Wireless auto power trip__

__Description:__
This project implements the prevention of fire due to electricity when a gas leakage happens. A gas sensor is used to detect the leakage of gas and the data sensed by it is processed by a microcontroller. This controller is connected to an RF transmitter. On the receiver end, an RF receiver sends the recieved signal to a microcontroller which processes it and takes a decision based on that. If the leak is below safety levels, the controller doesn't change anything whereas if it is hazardous it switches on the alarm system (comprising of LED, LCD and a buzzer). Also, it relay trips the power supply to prevent any fire due to passage of electricity.
