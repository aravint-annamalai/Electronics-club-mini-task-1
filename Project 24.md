__Project 24: Electronic juice vending machine__

__Description:__
This is a simple project where a juice vending machine can be activated wirelessly using bluetooth technology. The vending machine is controlled by an ATMEGA328P microcontroller. The user has to selct the juice he wants. The info is transmitted via bluetooth to the vending machine. Also, the controller checks whether a glass is placed or not using an IR sensor. If present, it operates the corresponding motor to pour the juice. If not present, it displays the message that the glass isn't present on an LCD display. The microcontroller can be programmed using C language.
