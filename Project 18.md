__Project 18: Home automation using Raspberry Pi__

__Description:__
In this project, wireless home automation is achieved using Raspberry Pi microcomputer. In the proposed project, the features are:

Turning on or off the lights

Sensing whether the doors are open or not and hence, also remote-controlling them

Webcam surveillance

Since the RPi board itself is a microcontroller board, it can be used to integrate the sensors and control systems with the client devices through ethernet module. RPi enables it as it can also act as a wireless communicator when a Wi-Fi ethernet card is attached to it. Also, the images and videos taken by the webcam can be stored in a cloud database for future purposes. The RPi controller can be programmed using Python language.
