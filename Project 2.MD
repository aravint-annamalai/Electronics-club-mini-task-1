__Project 2: Boolean expression minimizer__

__Description:__

This simple circuit aims at minimizing the boolean expression given in terms of minterms. 
A keypad consisting of 9 digits is used where the first 8 keys act as the minterms and the ninth key acts as the next button. 
The main component of this project is the ATMEGA16L microcontroller which acts as the calculator. 
The display is 3 bi-color LEDs which are used to serially display the minterms of the reduced expression. 
The minterms are displayed one at a time using the next button. 

Also the main component is the ATMEGA16L microcontroller. It has various applications in control, instrumentation and embedded systems. 
Being a microcontroller, it can be used in systems like temperature controller, gas leakage indicator, etc. 
In this particular project, it is coded according to the Quine-McCluksey algorithm.
