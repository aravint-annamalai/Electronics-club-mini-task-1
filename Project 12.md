__Project 12: IOT based smart health care__

__Description:__
Internet of things or IOT is an important technology existing in the current era. It is employed to send or receive messages via the internet. This project uses this technology to constanly store the patients' health conditions in webpages and also alerts the doctors if anything goes wrong. Also, a GSM module is present which sends an SMS to the doctor and hence, alerting him. If the data of some patient is needed, the doctor can always type the required website name and get the info. The websites also get refreshed periodically based on the data obtained from the microcontroller.

The important components are PIC18F46K22 microcontroller, GSM module and Wi-Fi module ESP8266. The microcontroller obtains the data from various sensors, processes it and takes decision based on that. The GSM module is responsible for transmitting data wirelessly via SMS. The ESP8266 module provides TCP/IP configured internet access to this system and hence enables the patient data to be updated into web pages which are available for future use.
