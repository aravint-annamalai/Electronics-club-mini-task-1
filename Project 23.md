__Project 23: Smart wheel chair__

__Description:__
This project is a smart wheel chair which can be controlled wirelessly using RF technology. An touchscreen display is connected to a Raspberry Pi microcomputer which in turn is connected to a mic, GPS and GSM modules and also to an RF transmitter. The RF receiver is connected to motor drivers which are connected to the servo motors.

When the user touches the touchscreen to give commands, the RPi proceeses it and sends some signals to the motor drivers via the RF module. Also, if the user falls and gets hurt, he can inform the assistant by pressing an emergency button or even by voice command via the mic. Either of these two commands will trigger the microcomputer to send the location obtained from the GPS module to the assistant as an SMS via the GSM module.
