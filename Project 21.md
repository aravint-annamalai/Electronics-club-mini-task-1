__Project 21: 3D Gesture controller robot__

__Description:__
In this project, a glove attached to a MEMS accelerometer sensor is worn by the user. The tilt of his hand is sensed by the sensor and sent to a microcontroller which is connected to a zigbee module. This zignbee wireless transceiver transmits the message to the robot. This robot is also controlled by a microcontroller which is attached to a zigbee receiver module.

This project has a lot of advantages over joystick and remote control technologies since the buttons may eventually get worn out in time whereas that is not the case with our hands. Also, the noise signal generated will be highly attenuated in this case. The microcontrollers can be programmed using embedded C language.
