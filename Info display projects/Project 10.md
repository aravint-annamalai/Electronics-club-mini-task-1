__Project 10: Wireless electronic notice board__

__Description:__
This project aims at acting as a small notice board which displays messages on an LCD using wireless technology. Also, it contains a human presence detecting system and hence, can automatically turn the lights on or off in that room according to the data obtained from the PIR sensors it has.

The main components are:

LPC2138 ARM microcontroller

Zigbee module

20x4 LCD display

The ARM microcontroller is coded using VB (Visual basic) language. The data to be shown is recieved from the PC using the zigbee module. The lights are controlled using relay drivers. Also, an EEPROM is used as an external memory source to store the latest data if power goes off suddenly.
