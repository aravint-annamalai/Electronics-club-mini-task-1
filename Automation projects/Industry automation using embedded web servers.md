__Project 22: Industry automation using embedded web servers__

__Description:__
In this project, various physical parameters like temperature, pressure, etc. are measured using sensors and monitored. If required, they are also controlled by relay controlling the associated control devices like exhaust fans. All the processing is done by an ARM microcontroller and the embedded web servers are updated based on the authentication received from authorised personnel. 

For wireless communication, an ethernet module is attached to the microcontroller using which the microcontroller can now send and recieve requests from the users and also store the data in embedded web servers. The paricular ARM microcontroller used is LPC2138. Also, an LCD display is present for displaying the data.
