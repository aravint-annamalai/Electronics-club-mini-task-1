__Project 5: Automated electricity billing system__

__Description:__
In this project, the power consumed (in Kwh) is directly transmitted to the electricity board as well as to the consumer via Labview, Zigbee and GSM technologies. An ATMEGA32 microcontroller is used to collect the data, Zigbee is used to wirelessly transmit it, Labview for calculating the bill amount based on the power consumed and GSM to send an SMS to the consumer.

The benefits of this system are:

No need to physically come and check the meter reading

Fraudulence by the meter reading checkers can be prevented

No need to maually enter the data as it can be automatically stored in this project.
