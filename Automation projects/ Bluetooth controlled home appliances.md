__Project 4: Bluetooth controlled home appliances__

__Description:__
This project aims at controlling switches of home appliances using wireless technology, namely bluetooth for this project. An android bluetooth application is installed in the mobile phone of the concerned user and using this app, he/she can control the appliances which are within the range of the bluetooth. This project would be extremely helpful for elederly and handicapped people who can now just simply switch on or off a fan or a light in their room by just sending the concerned password through the app.

The main components involved are the 8051 AT89C51 microcontroller and the bluetooth module HC-05. The microcontroller acts as the input receiver and output transmittor. It can be programmed according to our needs using a 8051 programmer board. The HC-05 module receives the data sent from the phone and transmits it to the microcontroller. Also, a 16x2 LCD is used to display the staus of the appliances and the last entered password.
