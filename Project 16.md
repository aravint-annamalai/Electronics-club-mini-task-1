__Project 16: Object sorting robot using image processing__

__Description:__
This project is a simple bot which classifies objects based on their colour, picks them and places them are required spots. A webcam is used to capture the images and MATLAB software is used to process and classify the images based on color. According to the processed data, the ARM microcontroller sends output to an LCD display and also activates the robot's arm and gripper motors to pick the object.

The main components used are the ARM microcontroller, color keys, webcam and the motor drivers. When a color key is pressed, the MATLAB software starts searching for the images of that particular color and based on its output, the microcontroller activates the motors through motor drivers.
